      <h1>Yugioh Tutorial: The Basics</h1>
    </section>
    <section id="Ruleset">
      <h2>Ruleset</h2>
      <p>The Yugioh Ruleset consists of these basic principles</p>
      <ul>
        <li>There are two players, each with 8000 life points (LP for short). This is their Health bar. When it reaches zero, that player will lose.</li>
        <li>Each player starts with 5 cards.</li>
        <li>There are 2 decks for each player: the main deck, which consists of normal, effect, spell, and trap cards (minimum of 40, maximum of 60), and the extra deck, which contains Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, and Link monsters (0-15 cards).</li>
        <li>If a player runs out of cards to draw, they lose the duel.</li>
        <li>The game consists of 6 phases: draw, standby, main, battle, main 2, and end.</li>
        <li>The phases are:
          <ul>
            <li>Draw Phase: The player draws one card from their main deck. The player who plays the first turn of the game does not draw in their draw phase.</li>
            <li>Standby Phase: Nothing happens unless a card's effect activates during this phase.</li>
            <li>Main Phase: The player summons monsters and activates spells and traps to employ their strategy.</li>
            <li>Battle Phase: The player commands their monsters to attack the other player. The first turn of the game does not have a battle phase.
              <ul>
                <li>When battling, the monster with the higher attack wins. The player only takes damage when their monster is attacked in attack mode.</li>
                <li>When attacking a monster with higher defense, the attacker takes damage, but neither card is destroyed.</li>
                <li>When monsters with equal attack points battle, both are destroyed.</li>
                <li>When there are no monsters to attack, the player can attack their opponent directly, reducing their LP.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Main Phase 2: Similar to Main Phase 1.</li>
            <li>End Phase: The player ends their turn. Effects that activate during the end phase trigger here.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>There are two main ways to summon monsters: Normal Summons and Special Summons.
          <ul>
            <li>Normal Summon: The player places a monster card from their hand onto the field. This can only be done once per turn.</li>
            <li>Special Summon: The player places a monster from their hand or deck based on a card's effect. This can be done multiple times per turn.</li>
            <li>Flip Summon: When a face-down monster is flipped face up, often to activate its effect.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>When cards are removed from play, they go to either the Graveyard or the Banishment Zone.
          <ul>
            <li>The Graveyard: Cards destroyed or used go here. Effects that have Graveyard requirements activate here.</li>
            <li>Banishment Zone: Cards that are banished are sent here. Some effects can interact with banished cards, but face-down banished cards are unplayable.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The field has zones for monsters, spells, traps, field spells, and extra deck monsters.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="Types">
      <h2>Types of Yugioh Monsters</h2>
      <p>There are various types of monsters, each with levels from 1-12 and their own attack and defense points.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Normal
          <ul>
            <li>Normal Monsters are the basic monsters with no special effects and their text below is just a description of the card itself.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Effect
          <ul>
            <li>Effect Monsters are monsters with special effects with certain conditions to be met, unlike normal monsters they have no description of the card itself.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Pendulum
          <ul>
            <li>Pendulum Monsters are similar to effect monsters, the main difference is that they have their own effects called pendulum effects.</li>
            <li>The Pendulum effects activate when they are in the pendulum zones (which is in the spell/trap zones, each to the far right and left).</li>
            <li>Each pendulum monster has a scale going from 0-12.</li>
            <li>Depending on the range of the two pendulum monsters, pendulum cards can be pendulum summoned. Example: One side is 1 and the other is 3, only level 2 pendulum monsters can be summoned from the hand.</li>
            <li>Pendulum monsters can also be Fusion, Synchro, and XYZ Monsters.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Fusion
          <ul>
            <li>Fusion Monsters have certain requirements in order to be summoned, usually involving specific types of monsters.</li>
            <li>All cards used for the summon normally go to the graveyard or banishment zone, depending on the card's effect.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Synchro
          <ul>
            <li>Synchro Monsters are normal and effect monsters that require two or more monsters, including a tuner monster, to be summoned. This is called Synchro Summoning.</li>
            <li>Synchro Monsters also have different types of monsters that are always needed; a tuner and a non-tuner are always required.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>XYZ
          <ul>
            <li>XYZ Monsters are normal and effect monsters that require two or more monsters with the exact same level to be summoned, known as XYZ Summoning.</li>
            <li>Similar to Fusion and Synchro, all cards have different requirements.</li>
            <li>The cards don’t immediately go to the graveyard; instead, you stack the cards on top of each other with the XYZ monster on top.</li>
            <li>To use their effects, they must remove at least one "material" (the cards used for the summon).</li>
            <li>Usually, the only way to gain more material is via a spell card or a monster's effect.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Link
          <ul>
            <li>Link Monsters have no defense value and can only be placed in attack mode. They require 1 or more monsters to be summoned.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Yugioh Spell and Trap Cards</h2>
      <p>Spell and Trap cards provide a variety of effects, supporting various strategies.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Spell Cards
          <ul>
            <li>Spell Cards are cards with effects that help the player employ a strategy.</li>
            <li>Spell Cards can be placed face down and activated immediately as long as the requirements are met.</li>
            <li>There are Continuous Spell Cards that last the whole game unless removed or destroyed.</li>
            <li>There are Quick Play Spell cards that can be played during the opponent's turn in order to counter their strategy.</li>
            <li>There are Field Spell cards that can be played in the field spell zone and are similar to continuous spell cards.</li>
            <li>There are Equip Spell cards which, when activated, enhance a monster's attack/defense or give it an effect.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Trap Cards
          <ul>
            <li>Trap cards are similar to spell cards; however, they must be placed face down for at least until the end of that player's turn.</li>
            <li>Trap cards can always be used during an opponent's turn in order to stop their strategy.</li>
            <li>There are Continuous Trap Cards, which, when activated, last the entire game unless removed or destroyed.</li>
            <li>There are Counter trap cards that can only be activated in response to another player's actions.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

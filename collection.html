        <h1>Collecting Items</h1>
        <p>Something about me is that I love collecting items, mainly trading cards and manga during my free time, as well as some plushes</p>
        <p>It all started around the 2010's with pokemon cards, it was the first time I went to a target and I saw the pokemon card section, I opened of what was considered a pack of XY origins, with cool looking cards that I wanted, after that it was phases.<p>
        <p>It was first with pokemon, then Yugioh, then it was manga because at the time it was easier to read and helped improve my reading in my earlier years of school.<p>
        <p>To this day, I still collect things as it helps with a lot in my life, I mainly use it to reward myself for the smaller accomplisments and to help me push foward.<p>

        <p>This is a picture of some the plushes I have, these specifically I got from my brother a couple christmas's ago which reignited my love for pokemon, at the time I was more focused on school and work and I didn't really collect things, it was a very dark period for me however in the I was happy about it.<p>

      <section id='Manga'>
	    <h2>Manga</h2>
        <img class="imageC" src="images/mymanga.jpg" alt="Some manga i own with pokemon accessories">
        <p>This is a picture of some of my manga, specifically this one being my pokemon adventures series, this was a series that always alluded but I never started until 2023, which started with the first box set. In my personal opinion I like the series so far, I find the each indivdual stories played out really well and the art looks pretty cool.<p>

		    <p>This is a picuture of more manga, specifically of a series called Claymore by Norihiro Yagi, a personal favorite series of mine which I bought in 2023 as well. When first reading it, it had pretty good action, in the later chapters it gets really good its that I recommend this alot.</p>

      <section id='Cards'>
	    <h2>Cards</h2>
        <img class="imageE" src="images/yugiohcards.jpg" alt="2 pages of my one of my yugioh binders">
        <p>This is a picture of the pages in one of my yugioh binders, as stated before yugioh was one of the second things I started to collect after pokemon. Fun Fact, I used to competitvly play the game for awhile, mainly playing at local tornaments eventually I could not keep up due to the fact that I do not have much money and cards that are really good in the game are expensive.<p>
		    <img class="imageF" src="images/pokemoncards.jpg" alt="5 pokemon cards that were grouped together">
		    <p>These are some pokemon cards, 4 of them are from more recent sets as i started collecting here and there, the vaporeon is from the jungle set released in 1999 and is one of my favorite cards</p>
